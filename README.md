**Networking RAG Projects**


This repository contains three implementations of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Networking, each offering different levels of sophistication in handling network related aspects.

**Naive RAG â€“ A simple retrieval-based approach using traditional methods.**
**Advanced RAG (Raptor-based) â€“ An optimized RAG pipeline leveraging Raptor for high-performance retrieval.**
**AI-Based RAG â€“ A fully autonomous agent-driven RAG system that dynamically adapts to network issues.**

These projects aim to assist network engineers, architects, and operations teams by improving how they access, retrieve, and utilize networking knowledge.

**1. Naive RAG for Networking**

Overview
The naive RAG implementation provides a basic retrieval mechanism for networking data. It uses BM25, TF-IDF, or FAISS-based retrieval combined with a language model (GPT, Llama) to provide relevant responses based on network configurations, RFCs, and vendor documentation.


**2. Advanced RAG for Networking (Raptor-based)**

Overview
This project enhances the naive implementation by integrating Raptor, a high-performance retrieval model, designed for fast and accurate document search. It supports multi-hop retrieval and can refine queries for complex networking problems.


**3. AI-Based RAG for Networking (Agentic RAG)**

Overview
The AI-based RAG system automates various networking opearations using multi-agent orchestration. This approach dynamically adjusts retrieval strategies based on the complexity of the networking issue.
